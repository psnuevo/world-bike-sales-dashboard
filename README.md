# World Bike Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes world bike sales data to uncover actionable trends and insights for business decision-making. Using Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, an interactive dashboard was developed to help stakeholders monitor revenue, profit, customer behavior, and product performance in real-time. The goal is to provide clear, data-driven insights that support business growth, profitability, and customer satisfaction.

## Methodology
- ### Data Cleaning:
    The dataset was first cleaned to remove duplicates and unnecessary columns.
- ### Analysis:
    Pivot tables, calculated fields, and various chart types (e.g., bar, line, treemap) were used to analyze trends in revenue, profit, and customer behavior.
- ### Dashboard Creation:
    An interactive dashboard was created in Excel to visually display the insights and allow stakeholders to filter and explore key metrics.

## Objectives 
- ### Present Revenue and Profit by year and country:
    Analyze and visualize revenue and profit trends across different countries over time.
- ### Identify customer demographics and behavior:
    Analyze how purchasing patterns differ by age, gender, and customer type to identify high-value customer segments and optimize marketing strategies.
- ### Evaluate Eco-Friendly Product Performance:
    Assess how eco-friendly products perform in comparison with non-eco-friendly one in terms of revenue, profit and customer satisfaction.
- ### Identify profit per country
    Analyze the profitability of different product categories to determine which categories contribute the most to overall profit.
